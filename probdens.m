function [pd_obs,edges,n_obs] = probdens(force,dF)
% Histogram of probability densities from experimennts
% Input:
%  force:  Array of recorded rip or zip forces
%  dF:     Force value spacing
%  n_obs   Number of rips or zips
% Output: 
%  pd_obs: Column vector of probality densities. 
%  edges:  Force bin edges. pd_obs(i) is the probability density for unfolding 
%          (or refolding) in the interval from edges(i) to edges(i+1)
%          
%  n_obs:  Number of observed rips or zips
