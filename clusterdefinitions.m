% Defining clusters for Top7  
% Input: Trip: Results table for rips
% Output: Clusters: 3 by height(Trip) logical array
%         Clusters(i,j) = true if rip no. i is in cluster j
%         clustersahpes: polyshape objects for plotting the cluster extent
%         in a Force  vs Delta x scatter plot
% NOTE:  If very few rips (e.g for slow pulling speed), clusters 2 and 3
%        is often combined to 1
%        Rips that are not in any cluster are denoted outliers:
%          outliers = ~any(clusters,2)
% The clusters are defined as rectangles in a Î”x - Force scatter plot
% The borders of the ractangles are adjusted so that the Bell model
% root-mean-square deviation between observation and fitted model is close
% to a minimum.
