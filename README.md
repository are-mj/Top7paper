"A possible universal intermediate identified during the folding of a metamorphic protein" by
Camila Graziele Corrêa1, Are Mjaavatten, Javiera Martínez Bilbao, Karina New, Steven Smith, 
Maximiliano F. Figueroa, and Christian A.M. Wilson.

The paper analyses results from optical tweezers experiments with unfoldinng and refolding the synthetic protein Top7.

The Matlab files currently in the repository were made for an those made for an earlier version of the paper.
The set of files have since been thoroughly reworked and expanded.  I am in the process of updating the repository and a new version willl be available shortly.

Due to file size limitations only 3 of 160 data folders are included as zip files 20220718, 20230623, and 20230623. They should be enough to test Tpo7the automatic rip and zip finding algorithm.
The Matlab tables in Top7tables.mat are sufficient to recreate nearly all figures and tables in the paper and Supplementary material.
