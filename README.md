"A possible universal intermediate identified during the folding of a metamorphic protein" by
Camila Graziele CorrÃªa et al.

The paper analyses results from optical tweezers experiments with unfoldinng and refolding of the synthetic protein Top7. The paper is based on the analysis of 10789 unfolding events (rips) and 11114 refolding events (zips) from 239 experiment files.
A few sample files are given in Experiment_postprocessing/SampleExperiments.zip.  The full set of experiment files (abour 3GB) is available from the authors.
