# Top7paper
Matlab m-files and sample experiment data files for paper "Top7 is a metamorphic and a possible prion-like protein" by 
Camila Graziele Corrêa1, Are Mjaavatten, Javiera Martínez Bilbao, Maximiliano F. Figueroa, and Christian A.M. Wilson.  
The paper was submitted to Nature on 2024-04-13.

The paper analyses results from optical tweezers experiments with unfoldinng and refolding the synthetic protein Top7.


Due to file size limitations only 3 of 160 data folders are included as zip files 20220718, 20230623, and 20230623. They should be enough to test Tpo7the automatic rip and zip finding algorithm.
The Matlab tables in Top7tables.mat are sufficient to recreate nearly all figures and tables in the paper and Supplementary material.
